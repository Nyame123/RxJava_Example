/**
 * Prefix Sum of Matrix (Or 2D Array)
 * Difficulty Level : Easy
 * Given a matrix (or 2D array) a[][] of integers, find prefix sum matrix for it. Let prefix sum matrix be psa[][].
 * The value of psa[i][j] contains sum of all values which are above it or on left of it.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Prefix Sum â€“ 1D
 * A simple solution is to find psa[i][j] by traversing and adding values from a[0][0] to a[i][j].
 * Time complexity o this solution is O(R * C * R * C).
 * An efficient solution is to use previously computed values to compute psa[i][j]. Unlike 1D array prefix sum,
 * this is tricky, here if we simply add psa[i][j-1] and psa[i-1][j], we get sum of elements from a[0][0] to a[i-1][j-1]
 * twice, so we subtract psa[i-1][j-1].
 * Example :
 *
 * psa[3][3] = psa[2][3] + psa[3][2] -
 *             psa[2][2] + a[3][3]
 *           = 6 + 6 - 4 + 1
 *           = 9
 * The general formula:
 * psa[i][j] = psa[i-1][j] + psa[i][j-1] -
 *             psa[i-1][j-1] + a[i][j]
 *
 * Corner Cases (First row and first column)
 * If i = 0 and j = 0
 *    psa[i][j] = a[i][j]
 * If i = 0 and j > 0
 *    psa[i][j] = psa[i][j-1] + a[i][j]
 * If i > 0 and j = 0
 *    psa[i][j] = psa[i-1][j] + a[i][j]
 * Below is the implementation of the above approach
