 * Huffman Coding | Greedy Algo-3
 * Difficulty Level : Hard
 * Last Updated : 23 Mar, 2021
 * Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length
 * codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of
 * corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the
 * least frequent character gets the largest code.
 * The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are Prefix Codes, means
 * the codes (bit sequences) are assigned in such a way that the code assigned to
 * one character is not the prefix of code assigned to any other character. This is
 * how Huffman Coding makes sure that there is no ambiguity when decoding the generated bitstream.
 * Let us understand prefix codes with a counter example. Let there be four
 * characters a, b, c and d, and their corresponding variable length codes be
 * 00, 01, 0 and 1. This coding leads to ambiguity because code assigned to
 * c is the prefix of codes assigned to a and b. If the compressed bit
 * stream is 0001, the de-compressed output may be (cccd) or (ccb) or (acd) or (ab).
 * See this for applications of Huffman Coding.
 * There are mainly two major parts in Huffman Coding
 *
 * Build a Huffman Tree from input characters.
 * Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters.
 * Steps to build Huffman Tree
 * Input is an array of unique characters along with their frequency of occurrences and output is Huffman Tree.
 *
 * Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap
 * of all leaf nodes (Min Heap is used as a priority queue. The value
 * of frequency field is used to compare two nodes in min heap. Initially, the least frequent character is at root)
 * Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap.
 *
 * Create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of
 * the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its
 * left child and the other extracted node as its right child. Add this node to the min heap.
 * Repeat steps#2 and #3 until the heap contains only one node. The
 * remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.
 * Let us understand the algorithm with an example:
 * character   Frequency
 *     a            5
 *     b           9
 *     c           12
 *     d           13
 *     e           16
 *     f           45
 *

 *
 * Time complexity: O(nlogn) where n is the number of unique characters.
 * If there are n nodes, extractMin() is called 2*(n â€“ 1) times.
 * extractMin() takes O(logn) time as it calles minHeapify(). So, overall complexity is O(nlogn).
 * If the input array is sorted, there exists a linear time algorithm. We will soon be discussing in our next post.
 *
 * Applications of Huffman Coding:
 * They are used for transmitting fax and text.
 * They are used by conventional compression formats like PKZIP, GZIP, etc.
 *  It is useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occurring character
