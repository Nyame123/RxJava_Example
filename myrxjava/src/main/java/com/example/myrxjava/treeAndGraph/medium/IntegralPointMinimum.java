/**
 * Find integral points with minimum distance from given set of integers using BFS
 * Difficulty Level : Medium
 * Last Updated : 20 Jul, 2021
 * Given an integer array A[] of length N and an integer K. The task is to find K
 * distinct integral points that are not present in the given array such that the sum
 * of their distances from the nearest point in A[] is minimized.
 * <p>
 * An integral point is defined as the point with both the coordinates as integers.
 * Also, in the x-axis, we donâ€™t need to consider y-coordinate because y-coordinated of all the points is equal to zero.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * Input: A[] = { -1, 4, 6 }, K = 3
 * Output: -2, 0, 3
 * Explanation:
 * Nearest point for -2 in A[] is -1 -> distance = 1
 * Nearest point for 0 in A[] is -1 -> distance = 1
 * Nearest point for 3 in A[] is 4 -> distance = 1
 * Total distance = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 which is minimum possible distance.
 * Other results are also possible with the same minimum distance.
 * Input: A[] = { 0, 1, 3, 4 }, K = 5
 * Output: -1, 2, 5, -2, 6
 * Explanation:
 * Nearest point for -1 in A[] is 0 -> distance = 1
 * Nearest point for 2 in A[] is 3 -> distance = 1
 * Nearest point for 5 in A[] is 4 -> distance = 1
 * Nearest point for -2 in A[] is 0 -> distance = 2
 * Nearest point for 6 in A[] is 4 -> distance = 2
 * Total distance = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 which is minimum possible distance.
