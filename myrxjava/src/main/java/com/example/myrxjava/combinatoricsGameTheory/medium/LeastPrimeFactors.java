 *Least prime factor of numbers till n
 * Difficulty Level : Medium
 * Last Updated : 19 Mar, 2021
 * Given a number n, print least prime factors of all numbers from
 * 1 to n. The least prime factor of an integer n is the smallest prime number
 * that divides the number. The least prime factor of all even numbers is 2.
 * A prime number is its own least prime factor (as well as its own greatest prime factor).
 * Note: We need to print 1 for 1.
 * Example :
 *
 * Input : 6
 * Output : Least Prime factor of 1: 1
 *          Least Prime factor of 2: 2
 *          Least Prime factor of 3: 3
 *          Least Prime factor of 4: 2
 *          Least Prime factor of 5: 5
 *          Least Prime factor of 6: 2
 *
 * We can use a variation of sieve of Eratosthenes to solve the above problem.
 *
 * Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, â€¦, n).
 * Initially, let i equal 2, the smallest prime number.
 * Enumerate the multiples of i by counting to n from 2i in increments of i, and
 * mark them as having least prime factor as i (if not already marked). Also mark i as
 * least prime factor of i (i itself is a prime number).
 * Find the first number greater than i in the list that is not marked. If there was
 * no such number, stop. Otherwise, let i now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
